# About our team

## Who we are 
Our unit consists few smaller teams responsible for: 
- Development of the Intranet — aka the Intranet Team
- Development of internal apps for managing office rooms and equipment — aka the Facility Team
- Development of AI solutions — aka the EJAJ Team
- Managing internal/external solution SLAs (handled by various individuals, not a specific team)

 ## Who will be your guides
 - Intranet Team
 - Facility Team
 - AI Team


 We’ve managed to engage people from all teams (maybe because most of us are part of two teams at once). You can ask us about these solutions and the processes around them. However, there’s one caveat: there may be information we’re not allowed to share. Please don’t expect us to break confidentiality rules. We’ll share as much as we can — but there is a limit, and it’s not the sky.

 ## Asking questions

We’ll answer all your questions to the best of our knowledge. ALL OF THEM. Even if the answer is:
- “We cannot tell.”
- “We don’t know.”
 
 ## We do not recognize stupid questions

As a team, we’d rather hear an obvious question with an easy answer than deal with mistakes that could’ve been avoided with a simple: “I need help.”

We all have deep experience in our areas of expertise — and we still use Google and ChatGPT/Copilot.
