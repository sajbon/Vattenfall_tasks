# Welcome to Powerpuff Internship Program 2025
 We hope you are doing well...

 ... enough to get to work!!!

We want all of you to have fun and get some technical and soft skills knowledge.

You will learn about team dynamics, work culture and corporate way of working on real life examples.

Do not worry we are not old, grumpy develompent team. We are young (at least at heart), fun (at least we hope we are) and we love memes. There will be games, prizes and shaking hands with the boss. 

## Purpose of the program
We want you to get to know: 

* Angular framework
* .NET framework 
* Developement team dynamics in corporate
* Team roles
* Why we care about the money (and we don't mean our monthly payments)
* Work ethics
* Work culture

Most important thing for us is that you remember that:  
- Asking questions is ok
- Not knowing how to do things you have never done before is ok
- We are only humans we make mistakes

## What will happen? 

Everyday we will have:
 * daily meetings to sum up previous day 
 * lecture/tech talk on one of the topics we prepared
 * everyday challenge for you to complete
 * time for you to try to complete nuclear reactors website project

## Why in english? 

As inernational corporation we use english in our everyday life. We also google a lot but most important reason is...

... copilot and chatGPT gives you better results when you write in english. Will we use polish as well? Of course! We can choose preffered language later :) But still all materials we prepared will be in english. Coincidence? (wink wink)

## Do I need to complete this program to get signature under my internship paperwork? 
No! We do not think that what we prepared for you is the most exciting and universal thing ever. However, we hope that you will benefit from our efforts.
